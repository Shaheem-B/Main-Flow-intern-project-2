Exploratory Data Analysis and sales prediction 

Objective:
➩The project involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on datasets to identify
trends, patterns, anomalies, and relationships among variables. Additionally, a Sales 
Performance Analysis was conducted to derive insights and build predictive models.

Task 1: General EDA

Steps Followed:
1)Dataset Selection:
➩Used a dataset (e.g., "Global Superstore") containing columns like Sales, Profit, Region, 
and Product Categories.

2)Data Cleaning:
➩Handled missing values by filling or removing affected entries.
➩Removed duplicate records.
➩Identified and treated outliers using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score).

3)Statistical Analysis:
➩Computed key metrics (mean, median, standard deviation, variance).
➩Analyzed correlations between variables.

4)Data Visualization:
➩Histograms for numerical data distributions.
➩Boxplots to detect outliers.
➩Heatmaps to visualize feature correlations.

Deliverables:
✅ A cleaned dataset with no missing values or duplicates.
✅ Summary report highlighting trends and anomalies.
✅ Visualizations including histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.

Task 2: Sales Performance Analysis

Steps Followed:
1)Dataset Selection:
➩Used "sales_data.csv" with columns like Product, Region, Sales, Profit, Discount, 
Category, and Date.

2)Data Cleaning:
➩Removed duplicate records.
➩Filled missing values using appropriate statistical methods.
➩Converted date column to datetime format for trend analysis.

3)Exploratory Data Analysis:
➩Time series graphs to study sales trends over time.
➩Scatter plots to analyze the relationship between Profit and Discount.
➩Bar/pie charts to show sales distribution by Region and Category.

4)Predictive Modeling:
➩Built a Linear Regression Model to predict Sales based on Profit and Discount.
➩Evaluated model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Deliverables:
✅ Visualizations: Time series plots, scatter plots, bar/pie charts.
✅ Predictive Model for Sales forecasting.
✅ Actionable insights to improve sales performance.

Key Outcomes
➩Gained expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
➩Identified factors affecting sales performance and derived insights.
➩Developed a simple predictive model for decision-making.
➩Improved time management and task prioritization skills by adhering to strict deadlines.

This project provided hands-on experience in real-world data analysis and business intelligence,
equipping learners with practical skills for data-driven decision-making.
